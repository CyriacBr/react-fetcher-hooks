# Installation

## Using yarn
```bash
yarn add 'use-fetcher-react'
```

### Using npm
```bash
npm install 'use-fetcher-react'
```

# Usage
`'use-fetcher-react'` exposes a component `Fetcher` that you are supposed to wrap around your content.  
That components handle automatically these fetching status: idle, loading, error.  
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Fetcher } from ''use-fetcher-react'';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Fetcher>
        My content
      </Fetcher>
    </div>
  );
}
```

But this won't do much in its own.  
`'use-fetcher-react'` also exposes `useFetcher` which return a Fetcher API. You can interact with it
inside your component and any visual feedback will be handled by the `Fetcher` component, with the condition
that you pass the API as a prop.  
```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFetcher, Fetcher } from ''use-fetcher-react'';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();
  useEffect(() => fetcher.setLoading(true), []);

  return (
    <div>
      <Fetcher>
        My content
      </Fetcher>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Minimal Example
Here's a minimal example of a component fetching being handled by `Fetcher`.  
The component **doesn't** have to react to the HTTP response nor does it have to show any loading feeback.  
All of that is handled by `Fetcher` automatically.
