# Fetcher Reference

The `Fetcher` component reacts to the behavior of the references it is tied to.
A reference is basically an API that let you send HTTP (but not only) requests with a simplified syntax.
You can create a reference using one of the hooks the library provides.

## Example

Here's an example on how to fetch from a REST GET endpoint with `useAxiosRequest`:
```ts
const [ref, get, items] = useAxiosRequest('http://myapi.com', true);
// 'items' is the result of the axios request
// 'get' can be called at later date to re-fetch

//...
<Fetcher refs={ref}>
  My Content
</Fetcher>
```
However, note that you are free to use the hooks without a `Fetcher` tied to it.
